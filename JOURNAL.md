## 10/15/2025 - ESP-NES schematics

The schematic for my custom ESP-NES is finally done! It feels great to have the complete electronic blueprint finalized on a single sheet.

The design is centered on an ESP32, connecting it to a display that conveniently has an SD card slot built-in, which really simplifies the wiring. I've also mapped out the PAM8403 audio amplifier and all eight of the tactile buttons for the controls.

With the logic and connections all laid out, the next and most exciting step is designing the physical PCB layout. It's time to bring this thing to life!
